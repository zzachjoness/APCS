## 1. Introduction

- An **algorithm** is a step by step process that describes how to solve a problem in a way that always give a correct answer
- There are often multiple algorithms that solve a particular problem, the best suited algorithm is typically the fastest solver
- There are three (3) basic building blocks of algorithms:
  - **Sequencing** of an algorithm is a step-by-step process, and the order of those steps is critical to esnure correctness
  - **Selection** can be used to determine a different set of steps to execute based on a Boolean expression
  - **Itteration** is used to execute steps a certain number of times or until a certain condition is met

## 2. Evaluation of Algorithms

- It is difficult to prove that an algorithm is correct
- Programmers often use:
  - **Emprical analysis** to find faults in an algorithm
    - Based on actual experimentation and observation of the results
    - Can only be used to prove that an implemented algorithm is _not_ correct, by discovering inputs where the output is unexpected
    - However, it **_==cannot prove that an algorithm is correct==_**
  - Only **formal reasoning** can prove total correctness
